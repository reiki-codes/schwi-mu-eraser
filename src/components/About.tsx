          <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
            We've all been there - a perfect family photo, except for that one person who just had to 
            photobomb or ruin the moment. SchwieMuEraser was born from the simple idea that sometimes, 
            family peace is just one AI-powered removal away.
          </p>
          <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
            Whether it's your annoying cousin, an ex, or just someone who blinked at the wrong moment, 
            we believe everyone deserves the perfect family photo. So we built this tool to make it 
            happen - quickly, easily, and with a touch of humor.
          </p>
          <p className="text-sm text-muted-foreground italic pt-4">
            P.S. - This is meant to be fun! Please use responsibly and with good intentions. üôè
